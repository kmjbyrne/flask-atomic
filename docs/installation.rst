Installation
============

    .. note::

        Package was developed using Python 3.6. No guarantee is given for
        backwards compatibility with older versions of Python. Especially
        Python < 3.x.


    .. warning::

        This guide assumes a foundation understanding of Flask and Blueprints.
        Blueprints are essentially smaller application units that fit into the
        larger Flask application instance. This is akin to 'apps' in Django.

From the PyPi repository

    .. code-block::

        pip install Flask-Atomic
