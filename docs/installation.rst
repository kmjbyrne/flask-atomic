Installation
=========================

    .. note::

        Package was developed using Python 3.6. No guarantee is given for
        backwards compatibility with older versions of Python. Especially
        Python < 3.x. If you have to ask if this works with Python 2,
        perhaps you should consider migrating.


    .. warning::

        This guide assumes a foundation understanding of Flask and Blueprints.
        Blueprints are essentially smaller application units that fit into the
        larger Flask application instance. This is akin to 'apps' in Django.


Installation
------------

From the PyPi repository

`pip install Flask-Atomic`
